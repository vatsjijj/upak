# UPAK
The Udin package manager.

This little thing is currently in its infancy but it kinda works, so go upak!

# Installation
You need `pip3` and `udin`, you can find Udin easily on my page.

That's it.

If you already have upak built, run `upak build` and it will be built.

If you don't, run `udin c src/upak.udin`.

# Usage
`upak add <packages>`

`upak install`

And you're done.

There is a demonstration video [here](https://youtu.be/DDKYNaLK1OA).
