# UPAK
The Udin package manager.

This little thing is currently in its infancy but it kinda works, so go upak!

# Installation
You need `pip3` and `udin`, you can find Udin easily on my page.

That's it.

# Usage
`upak add <packages>`

`upak install`

For example:
```
upak add raylib numpy
upak install
Are you sure you want to install these packages? [y/n]
y
[pip3 output here]
```

And you're done.
